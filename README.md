AI Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is a Python-based visualization of classical AI search algorithms on a 10×10 grid.
It shows how different strategies explore nodes and find a path from Start (S) to Target (T).

How to Run

Install dependencies:

pip install matplotlib numpy


Run the file:

python main.py


Select an algorithm from the dialog box.
